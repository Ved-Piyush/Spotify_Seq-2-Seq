# Spotify_Seq-2-Seq

The datafiles required to run this code are in all_train/training_Set. Github was not allowing to upload individual files which are more than 100 MB so the datafiles in this folder are zip files. To run this code, you can unzip the files first and keep them in the same folder because the code points to this folder. Make sure to delete the zip files after you have unzipped them because the code assumes that the data folder only has the csv files.
